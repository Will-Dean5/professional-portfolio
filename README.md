### About Me
This is a website that I have created that shows an about me section that breifl gives you an understanding about me as a person.

### Work
 A work section that shows previous projects and place holder images for the projects that are to come. The first image that is larger shows the only project that I have done so far and if you click on the picture it will take you to the webpage in a new tab.
 
 ### Contact Me
  Below the work section there is a section for information that can be used to contact me and it has my github profile linked.
